VThe service is awful.
p4
sV346
p5
VThis place is not worth the prices.
p6
sV347
p7
VAlso, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.
p8
sV340
p9
VThe rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
p10
sV341
p11
VFurthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
p12
sV342
p13
VThe fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
p14
sV343
p15
VIt is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
p16
sV348
p17
VGreat sushi experience.
p18
sV349

p37
VThe service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better.
p38
sV296
p39
VThey did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
p40
sV297
p41
VAnd at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.
p42
sV294
p43
VThree strikes and this restaurant is out.
p44
sV295
p45
VEverything that happened was not even up to mediocre.
p46
sV292
p47
VI went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.
p48
sV293
p49
VJust don't do it.
p50
sV291

sV270
p55
VFrom the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.
p56
sV271
p57
VThese innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
p58
sV272

VPair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.
p60
sV273
p61
VWe had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
p62
sV274
p63
VOff the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.
p64
sV275
p65
VRaga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.
p66
sV276
p67
VWe were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.
p68
sV277
p69
VFrom beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.
p70
sV278
p71
VI am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch.
p72
sV279
p73
VI guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.
p74
sV738
p75
VFrom the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.
p76
sV581
p77
VWe'd go back again
p78
sV2268
p79
VMy only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
p80
sV2269
p81
VI know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
p82
sV2262
p83
VThe spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
p84
sV2263
p85
VWe went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
p86
sV2260
p87
VWhat's the difference between the two?
p88
sV2261
p89
VTheir sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
p90
sV2267
p91
VGood, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.
p92
sV2442

p94
sV2443

p102
sV2447
p103
VNot pretentious and very economical.
p104
sV2444
p105
VThe secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
p106
sV2445
p107
VThe bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.
p108
sV2448
p109

p110
sV2449
p111
VThe Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.
p112
sV109
p113
VI haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.
p114
sV102
p115
VEmilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.
p116
sV103
p117
VGoing to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
p118
sV101
p119
Vi love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
p120
sV2042
p121
VNot worth the prices.
p122
sV2040
p123
VThe makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
p124
sV2041
p125
VThe best thing I tasted were the lambchops.
p126
sV1297
p127
VThey're rude at times, and not very friendly.
p128
sV1373
p129
VDO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
p130
sV3155
p131
VThey are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.
p132
sV2838
p133
VThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
p134
sV3159
p135
VTheir coffee is quite good too!
p136
sV1001
p137
VThis is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.
p138
sV3519
p139
VThe prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
p140
sV3518
p141
VI recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
p142
sV3513
p143
VThe service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.
p144
sV3512
p145
VWhen asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
p146
sV3511
p147
VA gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
p148
sV3510
p149
VI was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
p150
sV3517
p151
VThe food always tastes fresh and served promptly.
p152
sV3516
p153
VThe prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.
p154
sV3515
p155
VThis is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff.
p156
sV3514
p157
VNever again!
p158
sV2688
p159
VThe food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
p160
sV2689
p161
VRecommendations, of course, are required!
p162
sV2686
p163
VThe place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
p164
sV2687
p165
VPeople dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
p166
sV2681
p167
VThe white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
p168
sV1436
p169
Vmy picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).
p170
sV645
p171
VYou are treated just like royality.
p172
sV3393
p173
VFor many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.
p174
sV98
p175
VBallato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.
p176
sV1435
p177
VQuality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.
p178
sV91
p179
VI will be going back and heartily recommend it!
p180
sV90
p181

p182
sV93
p183
VMy friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.
p184

p194
sV1623
p195

p203
VAlain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent.I
p204
sV1626
p205
VWonderful at holiday time.
p206
sV1625
p207
VThe only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
p208
sV1624
p209
VThe only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
p210
sV1998
p211
VI will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!
p212
sV3396
p213
VEverything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.
p214
sV3209
p215
VI will never visit this restaurant again.
p216
sV3208
p217
VDon't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo.
p218
sV2860
p219
VMy entire family was horrified.
p220
sV2861
p221
VWhile the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency.
p222
sV2862
p223
VBesides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.
p224
sV2863
p225
VPlease save yourself the frustration.
p226
sV2864
p227
VWhen we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
p228
sV558
p229
VThere are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.
p230
sV555
p231
VMake sure you try this place as often as you can.
p232
sV554
p233
VThe people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
p234
sV557
p235
VThe service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
p236
sV556
p237
VI am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list.
p238
sV551
p239
VWe were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.
p240
sV550
p241
VWe have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
p242
sV553
p243
VWhen we sat, we got great and fast service.
p244
sV552
p245
VAs always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
p246
sV3015
p247
VAfter we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!
p248
sV1199
p249
VThe sauces used are also not that exciting.
p250
sV1198
p251
VThe fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.
p252
sV1191
p253
VKnowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.
p254
sV3343
p255
VThe food now is inconsistent.
p256
sV3340
p257
VThis restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.
p258
sV3341
p259
VDuring the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
p260
sV1195
p261
VThe sushi is average and the prices are anything but.
p262
sV1194
p263
VI've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.
p264
sV1197
p265
VHad we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!
p266
sV1196
p267
VThe service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.
p268
sV1759
p269
VWe got most of it back at home with us.
p270
sV1756
p271
VThe price very reasonable.
p272
sV1755
p273
VThe pizza was pretty good and huge.
p274
sV1750
p275
VLocated at the end of a magnificent block.
p276
sV1177
p277
VSO SO SO SO SO good!
p278
sV1176
p279
VI almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself!
p280
sV1175
p281
VGet your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.
p282
sV1174
p283
VAlthough the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.
p284
sV1173
p285
VAt 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.
p286
sV1171
p287
VNever in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3.00 in NYC.
p288
sV1170
p289
VI go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.
p290
sV1179
p291
VI wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.
p292
sV1178
p293
VAnd cheap!
p294
sV1007
p295
VThey don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.
p296
sV1006
p297
VI've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.
p298
sV513
p299
VTold us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.
p300
sV1285
p301
VI live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
p302
sV1287
p303
VI live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.
p304
sV1286
p305
VIt hits the spot every time
p306
sV1281
p307
VGreat atmoshere and worth every bit.

VLove Pizza 33..
p312

p313
VOpen late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
p314
sV1289
p315
VEverything a NY pizza joint should be.
p316
sV1288
p317
VThe owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.
p318
sV514
p319
VStepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
p320
sV1579
p321
VAnd really large portions.
p322
sV1578
p323
VOur food was great too!
p324
sV689
p325
VSaul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
p326
sV688
p327
VI think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.
p328
sV3431
p329
VNot cheap, but not that expensive either.
p330
sV685
p331
VNot sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!
p332
sV1572
p333
VHowever, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
p334
sV1571
p335
VIt is very overpriced and not very tasty.
p336
sV686
p337
VI've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
p338
sV1577
p339
VI think the stuff was better than Disney.
p340
sV680
p341
VIt's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
p342
sV1575
p343
VOur family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
p344
sV1574
p345
VThis place is so much fun.
p346
sV1227
p347
VBagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
p348
sV875
p349
VWhen we arrived at 6:00 PM, the restaurant was practically empty.
p350
sV459
p351
VFresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
p352
sV3434
p353
VOh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!
p354
sV1240
p355
VApparently, the good cook works then.
p356
sV873
p357
VBased on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.
p358
sV3436
p359
VThe menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
p360
sV871
p361
VIf you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal.
p362
sV626
p363
VWe were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.
p364
sV2037
p365
VThis place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.
p366
sV2036
p367
VThat is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.
p368
sV1243
p369
VPlace should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...
p370
sV2035
p371
VWaiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.
p372
sV1371
p373
VThe hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
p374
sV406
p375
VIt melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.
p376
sV405
p377
VI tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
p378
sV1372
p379
VService was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
p380
sV1375
p381
VI love it.
p382
sV1374
p383
VI have been twice to this restaurant.
p384
sV1377
p385
VI found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
p386
sV400
p387
VIf you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.
p388
sV1379
p389
VTo me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
p390
sV1378
p391
VI recieved prompt service with a smile.
p392
sV409
p393
VWe took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
p394
sV408
p395
VThe rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
p396
sV1343
p397
VFluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.
p398
sV1242
p399
VBut the coconut rice was good.
p400
sV454
p401
VThis is one of our all-time favorite.
p402
sV2030
p403
VOur friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.
p404
sV379
p405
VAcceptable prices.
p406
sV378
p407
VMy fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
p408
sV370
p409
Vkalbi and nebbiolo do work together.
p410
sV375
p411
Vword of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.
p412
sV377
p413
VWe were a group of 8 and well seved.
p414
sV1244

p417
VOn the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.
p418
sV391
p419
VI stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
p420
sV390
p421
Vi would just ask for no oil next time.
p422

VAll in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.
p426
sV395
p427
VThe sake menu should not be overlooked!
p428
sV394
p429
VAside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
p430
sV2309
p431
VThere is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
p432
sV2308
p433
VI heartily recommend.
p434
sV2301
p435
VReally.
p436
sV2300
p437
Vless wait time for me!
p438
sV2303
p439
VAll conveniently delivered right to the door.
p440
sV2302
p441
VOur favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.
p442
sV2305
p443
VI've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
p444
sV2304
p445
VThey are FAST.
p446
sV2307
p447
VPersonal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
p448
sV2306
p449
VThe food is great.
p450
sV247
p451
VLived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.
p452
sV246
p453
VYeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
p454
sV241
p455
VOne of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.
p456
sV240
p457
VAuthentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
p458
sV249
p459
VI live on the street this place is on.
p460
sV248
p461
VOkay, so I never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown.
p462
sV2275
p463
VThis place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.
p464
sV2274
p465
VThough the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.
p466
sV2277
p467
VThe cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.
p468
sV2276
p469
VThe photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.
p470
sV2271
p471
VIf you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!
p472
sV2273
p473
VTheir sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.
p474
sV2272
p475
VThey offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
p476
sV2404
p477
VThe place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.
p478
sV2279
p479
VOverall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.
p480
sV2278
p481
VThe menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
p482
sV2459
p483
VI got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!
p484
sV2458
p485
VIt's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...
p486
sV2455
p487
VThe staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
p488
sV2454
p489
VI love the atmorphere @ peep!
p490
sV2457
p491
VAnd the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!
p492
sV2456
p493
VMy first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.
p494
sV2451
p495
VThe prices were fantastic.
p496
sV2450
p497
VWe had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.
p498
sV2453
p499
VMy husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.
p500
sV2452
p501
VThe seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.
p502
sV179
p503
VService was prompt, friendly and great.
p504
sV178
p505
VThe waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!
p506

VI had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
p508
sV176
p509
VThis place is great.
p510
sV175
p511
VThe decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
p512
sV174
p513
VAs many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.
p514
sV173
p515
VFood is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
p516
sV2051
p517
VIve been here so many times the waiters know my name.
p518
sV3699
p519
VLunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.
p520

p522
sV2052

sV2058
p531
VJUST AWSOME.
p532
sV3692
p533
VBut don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.
p534
sV3693
p535
Votherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.
p536
sV3694
p537
Vblack white shakes came out good also.
p538
sV3695
p539
Vsandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
p540
sV3696
p541
VUnlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).
p542
sV3697
p543
VThe corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.
p544
sV970
p545
VGrilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.
p546
sV655
p547
VI have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
p548
sV652
p549
VIt is expensive but well worth the money.
p550
sV653
p551
VIf you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.
p552
sV1367
p553
VDon't look down your nose at me like that...
p554
sV3526
p555
VWe go often.
p556
sV3527
p557
VThe food is nothing like its menu description.
p558
sV3524
p559
VWe always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
p560
sV3525
p561
VThe staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.
p562
sV3520
p563
VThere is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
p564
sV3521
p565
VEveryone I bring here always loves it.
p566
sV1508
p567
Vthey did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.
p568
sV3541
p569
VThey didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.
p570
sV3086
p571
VWhile the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.
p572
sV3081
p573
VI recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.
p574
sV3225
p575
VI particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.
p576
sV3083
p577

p582
sV2697
p583
VThe quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.
p584
sV2696
p585
VWe all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.
p586
sV2695
p587
VI went here with my boyfriend and another couple.
p588
sV2694
p589
VKudos to Po!
p590
sV2693
p591
VI recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
p592
sV1603
p593
VWould recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.
p594
sV2691
p595
VWhat an amazing meal and experience!
p596

VI'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.
p602
sV1972
p603
VI could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.
p604
sV1607
p605
VThe service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
p606
sV3222
p607
VAnd that's no mean feat...
p608
sV3232
p609

p610
sV3233
p611
VMy boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.
p612
sV3230
p613
VThe seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
p614
sV3236
p615
VYou get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.
p616
sV3237
p617
VAfter reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.
p618
sV3234
p619
VWe go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.
p620
sV1619
p621
VThey brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.
p622
sV1616
p623
VWe didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.
p624
sV1617
p625
VTwo people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.
p626
sV3238
p627
VBut on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.
p628
sV3239
p629
VBecause we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.
p630
sV1612
p631
VHave the iced tea.
p632
sV1961
p633
VThe table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.
p634
sV1610
p635
VThe pizza was great.
p636
sV1611
p637
VAnd it was quick which is very important.
p638

sV2871
p645
VLeon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
p646
sV2877
p647
VOur teenage kids love it, too.
p648
sV2876
p649
VHave been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
p650
sV2875
p651
VDecent wine at reasonable prices.
p652
sV2879
p653
VThe service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
p654
sV2878
p655
VThis place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.
p656
sV3355
p657
V- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.
p658
sV3354
p659
VIt was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
p660
sV3353
p661
V- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.
p662
sV3352
p663
Vbrick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.
p664
sV3359

p667
VI never had anything I didn't like here.
p668

VWaitstaff are very friendly.

sV1769
p671
VLove YUKA.
p672

p674
sV1760
p675
VI would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
p676
sV1766

VFood is excellent.

VFish is so very fresh.
p680
sV1765
p681
VLLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
p682
sV1140
p683
VAnyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
p684
sV1146
p685
VThis time, I prefer not to go into detail.
p686
sV1147
p687
VI seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again.
p688
sV1144
p689
VI've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.
p690
sV1145
p691
VI try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.
p692
sV1148
p693
VNot only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
p694
sV1149
p695
VI thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
p696
sV768
p697
VIf your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...

sV692
p701
VEvery time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
p702
sV1547
p703
VIt appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.
p704
sV690
p705
VFor those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
p706
sV691
p707
VThe food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
p708
sV1542
p709
VAs we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
p710
sV1543
p711
VThis should have been done in a back room - away from customers.
p712
sV694
p713
VI had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
p714
sV1541
p715
VThe hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale.
p716
sV698
p717
VThe duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
p718
sV699
p719
VThe wine list is interesting and has many good values.
p720
sV1548
p721
VThe food is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs.
p722
sV1549
p723
VLahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.
p724
sV542
p725
VI don't live in NY but my best friend does.
p726
sV1780
p727
VDespite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
p728
sV540
p729
VThe bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!
p730
sV541
p731
VI plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....
p732
sV547
p733
VI've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait.
p734
sV544
p735
VIt is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.
p736
sV763
p737
VWe were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.
p738
sV548

p744
sV761
p745
VFor an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
p746
sV2969
p747
VBill a little high, but worth it.
p748
sV1785
p749
VIt costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
p750
sV1786
p751
VThe spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
p752
sV1627
p753
VVolare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
p754
sV765
p755
VSushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.
p756
sV414
p757
VAverage to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.
p758
sV415
p759
VI've waited over one hour for food.
p760
sV416
p761
VThey were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
p762
sV417
p763
VA Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
p764
sV410
p765
VWe were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.
p766
sV411
p767
VThey kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!
p768
sV412
p769
VThe miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.
p770
sV413
p771
VWe were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.
p772
sV1384
p773
VIncredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.
p774
sV1385
p775
VService is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
p776
sV1386
p777
VThe food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.
p778
sV1387

p786
sV1383

p794
sV3583
p795
VConsequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
p796
sV368
p797
VThe table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.
p798
sV369
p799
VWe laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel.
p800
sV366
p801
VWe could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.
p802
sV367
p803
VThis was on a Tuesday night.
p804
sV364
p805
VAfter the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
p806
sV365
p807
V(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
p808
sV362
p809
VNice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.
p810

VFaan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.
p836
sV2192
p837
VMy GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.
p838
sV259
p839
VThis is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
p840
sV2194
p841
VThey don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
p842
sV2195
p843
VThe service is not consistently excellent -- just decent.
p844
sV2196
p845
VGet the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
p846
sV2197
p847
VThey need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.
p848
sV2198
p849
VFaan is sooo good.
p850
sV2199
p851
VThe best pad thai i've ever had.
p852
sV250
p853
VI understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.
p854
sV256
p855
VOkay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
p856
sV257
p857
VThe scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
p858
sV254
p859
VThis restaurant was way overhyped.
p860
sV255
p861
VMy chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
p862
sV2200
p863
VThe design and atmosphere is just as good.
p864
sV2201
p865
Vbottles of wine are cheap and good.
p866
sV2202
p867
VWhat more could you want?
p868
sV2203
p869
VSEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.
p870
sV2204
p871
VIt's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.
p872
sV2205
p873
VThe food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.
p874
sV2206
p875
VAfter being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
p876
sV2207
p877
VAnd, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.
p878
sV2208
p879
VNeedless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.
p880
sV2209
p881
VThis place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
p882
sV2428
p883
VAs a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
p884
sV2429
p885
VHowever, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.
p886
sV2400
p887
VTheir exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.
p888
sV2420
p889
VThe place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM.
p890
sV2421
p891
VFor all of you new to Indian food, try the Paneer Roll, it is a piece of heaven.
p892
sV2422
p893
VI like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down.
p894
sV2423
p895
VI live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.
p896
sV2424
p897
VIt's true, this place is not cheap.
p898
sV2425
p899
VI need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!
p900
sV2426
p901
VThey are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.
p902
sV2427
p903
VThis place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.
p904
sV2432
p905
VThe main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
p906
sV2791
p907
VThe porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
p908
sV168
p909
VPerhaps.
p910
sV169
p911
VI've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.
p912
sV164
p913
VThe entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
p914
sV165
p915
VIn terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.
p916
sV166
p917
VYet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.
p918
sV167
p919
VIf just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.
p920
sV160
p921
VWe ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
p922
sV161
p923
VI thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
p924
sV162
p925
VWent on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
p926
sV163
p927
VWe couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.
p928
sV3689
p929
VWe could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue.
p930
sV3688
p931
VIt is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
p932
sV3683
p933
VThey forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
p934
sV3682
p935
VThe wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
p936
sV3681
p937
VThe food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.
p938
sV3680
p939
VI almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
p940
sV3687
p941
VTook my sister here before attending a show one evening.
p942
sV3686
p943
VEating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
p944
sV3685
p945
VOverall, not worth the money.
p946
sV3684
p947
VAlso, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
p948
sV2796
p949
Vlove the food.
p950
sV2514
p951
Vits a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
p952
sV2515
p953
VThe New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.
p954
sV2516
p955
VThis is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights.
p956
sV2517
p957
VAuthentic food and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.
p958
sV2511

Veven the wine by the glass was good.
p964
sV2734
p965
VThe Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...
p966
sV2735
p967
VEverytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.
p968
sV2736
p969
VThis is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
p970
sV2737
p971
VThe service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
p972
sV2730
p973
VThis is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.
p974
sV2733
p975
Vby dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!
p976
sV2738
p977
VYou'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.
p978
sV2739
p979
VI'm partial to the Gnocchi.
p980
sV3531
p981
VMy friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
p982
sV3530
p983
VIt's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
p984
sV3533
p985
VStay away from this place.
p986
sV3532
p987
VAnyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.
p988
sV3535
p989
VThe decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices.
p990
sV3534
p991
VAll the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.
p992
sV3537
p993
VService could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.
p994
sV3536
p995
VThe lunch special is an asbolute steal.
p996
sV3539
p997
VSimilar to other Indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.
p998
sV3538
p999
VAfter reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.

p1032
sV1600
p1033
VThe combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.

sV3227
p1035
VIT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant.
p1036
sV1974
p1037
VHowever, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.
p1038

p1076
sV2843
p1077
VFrom the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.

VIs just the way it was in days gone by.
p1242

p1294
sV2216

p1336
sV2502
p1337
VThe space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.

p1370
sV3250

p1425
VBoth the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.
p1426
sV3332
p1427
VHowever, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.
p1428
sV1492
p1429

p1468
sV3200

p1474
sV2090
p1475
VI got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
p1476

VThe food was very good, but not very thai.
p1480
sV1120

p1486
sV1125

p1490

p1491

p1503
VI'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
p1504
sV3024
p1505

p1534
sV1012
p1535
VChinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.
p1536
sV1013

sV1236
p1539
VThe problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.

sV201
p2035
VAnyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.
p2036
sV200
p2037
VJust an odd group.
p2038
sV202
p2039
VSo, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it.
p2040
sV205
p2041
VThe waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely.
p2042
sV204
p2043
VThough you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
p2044
sV206
p2045
VOf course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!
p2046
sV209

sV2237
p2081
VIt just wasn't Thai.
p2082

VWell, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.

p2204
sV2418
p2205
VThe bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.

VThe food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
p2240
sV3278
p2241
VThe food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.
p2242
sV3279
p2243
VAnd the prices were way to high for what you get.
p2244
sV832

p2250
sV831
p2251

p2252
sV3470
p2253
VAnd forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.
p2254
sV837

VA bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.
p2258
sV835
p2259
VThe food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.
p2260
sV838
p2261
VThe aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge.
p2262
sV839
p2263
VGiven the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.
p2264
sV3478
p2265
VNow it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
p2266
sV3479

VAnd everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.
p2268
sV3
p2269
VThe staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
p2270
sV2937

sV3316
p2285
VThe lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
p2286
sV784

p2302
sV788

p2304
sV1723
p2305
VThe food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
p2306
sV1720

p2308
sV1721

p2314
sV3004

p2321
VThe staff is courteous and friendly.
p2322
sV3000
p2323

p2364

p2365
VAs far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.
p2366
sV505
p2367
VEven better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.
p2368

p2382
sV633
p2383
VWe weren't!
p2384
sV634
p2385
VThe prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
p2386
sV1217
p2387
VUnlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
p2388
sV1214

p2414
sV2894
p2415

p2416
sV2897
p2417
VWhile Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
p2418

p2428
sV1454
p2429
VThe only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
p2430

VThis is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City.
p2432

p2446

VAfter dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I've found little toninos.

sV2554
p2547

p2550
sV61
p2551
VThis is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
p2552
sV2558
p2553

p2572
sV2398

p2575
VThey are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.
p2576

VFirst of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
p2584
sV2771
p2585

p2586
sV2772
p2587
VThe tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
p2588

VSlightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.

p2636
sV911
p2637
VFood was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).

p2670

p2672
sV3265
p2673
VI must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.

p2914
sV483

p2944
sV196
p2945

p2972
sV2545
p2973
VI for one will never patronize them again.
p2974
sV2544
p2975
VI don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
p2976
sV2549
p2977

p2995
VThe dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
p2996
sV2389
p2997
VGood, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
p2998
sV2388
p2999
VThat's good and bad.
p3000

p3038
sV907

VThe establishment scores big points in presentation and style.
p3046

p3047
VTo dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside.
p3048
sV908
p3049
VOrsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.
p3050

p3051
VThe location is perfect.
p3052
sV1846
p3053
VThe highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.

p3092
sV1946
p3093

p3094
sV3255
p3095
VOne of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.
p3096
sV3298
p3097
VThe food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.
p3098
sV3299

VBut I'd go back
p3124
sV856
p3125
VAn oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.
p3126
sV3451
p3127
Voverall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.

p3129
VThe staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.
p3130

p3136
sV3458
p3137
VAll in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back.
p3138
sV3459
p3139
VWe have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.
p3140
sV858
p3141
VService is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.
p3142
sV859
p3143
VMeanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.

p3154
sV740
p3155
VThe manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.

VMy husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.
p3250
sV1270
p3251
VPlain and simple it's bad thai food.
p3252
sV613
p3253
VIf you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
p3254
sV1272
p3255
VDon't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door.
p3256

p3265
VIt's a steal!
p3266
sV1795
p3267

p3268
sV710
p3269

p3280
sV3114
p3281
VTo begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.
p3282
sV3113
p3283

p3284

p3292
sV1470
p3293
VBut the pizza is way to expensive.

sV1471
p3295
VA large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
p3296
sV1477
p3297
VThe portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
p3298
sV1474
p3299
VYes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
p3300
sV1475
p3301
VA big disappointment, all around.
p3302
sV1478
p3303

p3306
sV1495
p3307

p3308
sV1304
p3309
VWe actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
p3310
sV1305
p3311
VIn fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
p3312
sV1306
p3313
Vmy first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.
p3314

p3318
sV1301
p3319
VThe food was absolutely horrible!
p3320
sV1302
p3321
VAnd their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!
p3322
sV1303

p3334
sV494
p3335
VTry the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious.
p3336
sV2590
p3337

p3338
sV496
p3339
VBeing from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.
p3340
sV497
p3341

p3342
sV490
p3343
VIf you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
p3344
sV491

VPastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).
p3346
sV492
p3347

p3348
sV493

p3355
VWe will come back!!!
p3356
sV927
p3357
VOk, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.
p3358

p3359
VFood was average but tasty.
p3360
sV29
p3361

p3363
VThey're terrific!!
p3364
sV1705
p3365
VWhile certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.
p3366
sV3267
p3367
VIf you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option.
p3368
sV7
p3369
VI like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
p3370
sV1602

sV3665
p3373
VChance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.
p3374
sV3664
p3375
VDefinitely not a restaurant to skip!
p3376
sV3667
p3377
VBut when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.
p3378
sV3666
p3379
VYes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.
p3380

p3388
sV2280
p3389
VThe restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese.
p3390
sV2281
p3391
VIf you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards.

p3446

p3452
sV2593
p3453

p3454
sV3599

sV1870

p3470

p3472
sV1878
p3473
VThe wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.
p3474
sV1879
p3475
VIt saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.

Vwe were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
p3518
sV2115
p3519
Vbut when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
p3520
sV2116
p3521
Vthen we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
p3522
sV2117
p3523

p3544
sV3288
p3545
VThere's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).
p3546
sV1911
p3547
VI had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.
p3548
sV1910
p3549
VThe food is expensive, but worth every bite.
p3550
sV3285

p3614

p3632
sV776
p3633
VThe food was great.
p3634
sV771
p3635
VFor the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
p3636
sV770
p3637
VWe were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.
p3638
sV773
p3639
VAll we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
p3640
sV772
p3641
VIn reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
p3642
sV779
p3643
VMake reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
p3644

p3645
VA++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.
p3646
sV77

VHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
p3652
sV2979
p3653
VThe food was actually aweful.
p3654
sV72
p3655
VIt is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
p3656
sV3058
p3657
VGo only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.
p3658
sV3059
p3659
VThe appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.
p3660
sV2972
p3661
VFirst went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
p3662
sV3057
p3663
VLook elsewhere.
p3664

p3665
VWould definitely visit again.
p3666
sV2971
p3667
VRecommended.
p3668
sV2976
p3669
VGreat wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
p3670
sV2977
p3671
VIt may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
p3672
sV3050
p3673
VAfter all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
p3674
sV2975
p3675
VAdmittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
p3676
sV1041
p3677
VThe people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.
p3678
sV1040
p3679
VSo, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.

VMost of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.
p3692
sV1680

p3698
sV1687
p3699
VThe dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.
p3700
sV1686
p3701
VConsidering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
p3702
sV1689
p3703
VI wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.
p3704
sV1688
p3705
VAll my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.
p3706
sV1269
p3707
VInstead of wasting your time here: SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD.
p3708
sV1268
p3709
VThe mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
p3710
sV669
p3711
VBut too far east!
p3712
sV668
p3713
VCompared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.

sV666
p3717
VGreat service, great food.
p3718
sV665

p3720
sV664
p3721
VThe staff is also attentive and friendly.
p3722
sV663
p3723
VThe fried rice is really good too.

p3739
VThe hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
p3740
sV3122
p3741
VThe hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
p3742
sV3123
p3743
VWe were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
p3744
sV3120
p3745

p3746
sV3121

sV1468
p3755
VThis is a fun restaurant to go to.
p3756
sV1465
p3757
Vthough the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
p3758
sV520
p3759
VDid I mention the wine?
p3760
sV1467
p3761
Vgreat eats, good times.
p3762
sV1916
p3763
VIt's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
p3764
sV1461
p3765
VThis is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.
p3766
sV1460
p3767
VThe decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.
p3768
sV1462
p3769
VAppetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
p3770
sV1317
p3771
VBut for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high.
p3772
sV1316

p3774
sV1315
p3775

VI ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
p3780
sV1312
p3781
VThe two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
p3782
sV1311
p3783
VAmma is nothing special.
p3784
sV1310
p3785
VI'll keep this short.
p3786
sV1319
p3787
VThe most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.
p3788
sV1318
p3789
VIt cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
p3790
sV528
p3791
VWarm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
p3792
sV529
p3793

p3794
sV318

p3796
sV313
p3797
VVery good value
p3798
sV865
p3799
VYou must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
p3800
sV317
p3801
VYou won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.
p3802
sV316
p3803
VThere was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!
p3804
sV315
p3805
VI didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic.
p3806
sV864
p3807
VThe portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
p3808
sV867
p3809
VI loved it and would go again.
p3810
sV866
p3811
VThe staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
p3812
sV2025
p3813
VNo free drink.
p3814
sV2754
p3815
VPrice and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
p3816

p3817
VPizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
p3818
sV1334
p3819
VBy the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.
p3820
sV2752

p3824
sV447
p3825
VThis is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.
p3826
sV1330
p3827
VIt was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.
p3828
sV2692
p3829
VThe staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb.
p3830
sV3610
p3831
VA great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
p3832
sV3611
p3833
VOh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
p3834
sV2299
p3835
VFor all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.
p3836
sV3613
p3837
V(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).
p3838
sV3617
p3839
VAnother welcome addition to the neighborhood.
p3840
sV2293

p3844
sV2290
p3845
VBest Taiwanese food in NY!
p3846
sV2297
p3847
VBy far, the best pizza in Manhattan.
p3848
sV2296
p3849
VHowever, it is jus too good to not praise it.
p3850
sV2295
p3851
VI am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
p3852
sV2294
p3853
VThe cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
p3854
sV2569
p3855
VVisited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.
p3856
sV2568

p3858
sV288
p3859
VIf you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!
p3860
sV2560

VThis place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.
p3862
sV2563
p3863
VI work near-by, and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.
p3864
sV1615
p3865

p3866
sV2567

sV2585
p3889
VDelivery service is great too.
p3890
sV2584

p3895
VWe do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
p3896
sV2580
p3897
VIf it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience.
p3898
sV402
p3899
VI wasn't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special, but Tuesday Night.
p3900
sV2589

VThe plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.
p3902
sV2588
p3903
VFirst off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.
p3904
sV1861
p3905
VSo my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.
p3906
sV1860
p3907
VWe thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.
p3908
sV1865

VWe ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.
p3910
sV2980
p3911
VI'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
p3912
sV1867
p3913
VThe first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.
p3914
sV1866
p3915
VI had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.
p3916
sV1869
p3917

p3918
sV1868
p3919
VMy husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.

p3928
sV960
p3929
VThe restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
p3930
sV961
p3931
VI was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.
p3932
sV962
p3933
VEveryone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.
p3934
sV1613
p3935
VIt was wonderful.
p3936
sV401
p3937
VThe service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.
p3938
sV968
p3939
VTop spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.
p3940
sV969
p3941
VLight, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris.
p3942
sV2109
p3943
VThe sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).
p3944
sV2108
p3945
Vthis one is definintely my least favorite.
p3946
sV2103
p3947
VSteamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
p3948
sV2102
p3949
VThe rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
p3950
sV2101
p3951
VThey were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
p3952
sV2100
p3953
VDo not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
p3954
sV2107
p3955
VI've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.
p3956
sV2105
p3957
VA few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
p3958
sV2104
p3959
VThe wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
p3960
sV2639
p3961
VLuckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
p3962
sV2638
p3963
VWe could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
p3964
sV2635

p3966
sV2634

p3976

p3978
sV3438
p3979
VThe service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
p3980
sV3439
p3981
VThe only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
p3982
sV878
p3983
VSo if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe.
p3984
sV879
p3985
VBon appettite!!
p3986
sV876
p3987
VWhen we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy.
p3988
sV877
p3989
VSo some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise.
p3990
sV874
p3991
VI went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.
p3992
sV3433
p3993
VWould recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.
p3994
sV872
p3995

p3996
sV3435

p3998

p4002
sV2741
p4003

p4004
sV2740
p4005
VExcellent experience.
p4006
sV2743
p4007
VSkip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!
p4008
sV2034
p4009

p4010

VThe food was boring and expensive.
p4024
sV891
p4025
VThe food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.
p4026
sV892
p4027
VOur server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.
p4028
sV894
p4029
VEven with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
p4030
sV895
p4031
VOh right, I should probably say something nice.

p4628

p4868
sV2655
p4869
VThey couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
p4870
sV2654
p4871

p4872
sV133

p4874

p4889
VThe food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).

p4905
VWe began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.
p4906
sV2011

p4916
sV3561
p4917
VI've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants.
p4918

p4920
sV3567
p4921
VWe got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.
p4922
sV3564
p4923
VWondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.
p4924
sV3565
p4925
VAs there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.

Vi've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
p4930
sV2902
p4931
VStill, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
p4932
sV2901
p4933
VWhile the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.
p4934
sV2900
p4935
VThe beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good.
p4936
sV2907
p4937
Vservice is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.

VTry the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!
p4946

p4947

p4948
sV706

p4950

VThe svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!
p4960
sV89
p4961
VThe service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.

VThis big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!

VWe concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
p5008
sV1631
p5009
VThe wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
p5010
sV1632
p5011
VStill, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...

VDon't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.
p5022

p5028
sV2835
p5029
VThis place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.

p5033
VI can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.

sV2832
p5035

VI consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC.
p5050
sV1433
p5051
VIt is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.
p5052
sV3397
p5053
VIts also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
p5054
sV1431
p5055
VI don't think I would go again.
p5056
sV418
p5057
VThe food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
p5058
sV1981
p5059

VA touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
p5078
sV1345
p5079
VBarbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.
p5080
sV1346
p5081
VOverall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.
p5082
sV457
p5083
VI'd call it an 'italian dinner'.
p5084
sV3702
p5085
VThey came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.

p5116
sV651
p5117
VThe shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
p5118
sV3085
p5119
VThe place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.
p5120
sV3084
p5121
VThe food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
p5122
sV3087
p5123
VWhile most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.
p5124
sV1509
p5125
Vstill stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer...
p5126
sV767

p5141
VEverything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.
p5142
sV948
p5143
VI'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.
p5144
sV188
p5145
VOver time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
p5146

p5161
VCame looking for this place because I heard good things.
p5162
sV327

p5229
VOn a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.
p5230
sV2486
p5231
VThe noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.
p5232
sV2487
p5233
VYou can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.
p5234
sV2484
p5235
VBased on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.
p5236
sV2485
p5237
VThe menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.
p5238
sV2482
p5239
VEspecially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
p5240

p5250
sV2244
p5251
VI LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
p5252
sV2245
p5253
VI was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
p5254
sV2246
p5255
VI will go back to Suan soon!
p5256
sV52
p5257
VNo dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
p5258
sV2240
p5259
VThe service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
p5260
sV2241
p5261
VI have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
p5262
sV2242
p5263
VSuan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
p5264
sV2243
p5265
VIts location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.

p5326
sV2792
p5327
VA real dissapointment.
p5328
sV2793
p5329
VBut that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
p5330
sV2790
p5331
VToo bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
p5332
sV2063
p5333
Vwe decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.
p5334
sV2064
p5335

p5336
sV2065
p5337
VI definitely will go back.
p5338
sV2066
p5339
VDon't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.
p5340
sV2067
p5341
VDecor is nice though service can be spotty.
p5342
sV3374
p5343
VI'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.
p5344
sV135
p5345
VAnd it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).

p5359
VFor the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
p5360
sV3575
p5361
VAs we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.
p5362
sV3574
p5363
VWe weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.
p5364
sV3577
p5365
VSo rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
p5366
sV3576
p5367
VOur friends have not arrived yet.
p5368
sV3571
p5369
VThe food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.
p5370
sV3570
p5371
VFor two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.
p5372
sV3573
p5373
VThere are other people waiting!
p5374
sV3572
p5375
VImmediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
p5376
sV2666
p5377
VOverall a disappointing experience for that price category.
p5378
sV2667
p5379
VThe Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.
p5380
sV2664
p5381
VI am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
p5382
sV2665
p5383
VThis place is to be avoided.
p5384
sV2662
p5385
VUnbelievable.
p5386

sV1748
p5389
VGreat pizza and fantastic service.
p5390
sV2668
p5391
VThe waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.
p5392
sV2669
p5393
VI actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.
p5394
sV2938
p5395
Vthey didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.
p5396
sV2939
p5397
Vall the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.
p5398
sV2936
p5399
VThe strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.
p5400
sV3257
p5401
VThere is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
p5402
sV2934
p5403
VNot what I wanted to hear.
p5404
sV2935
p5405
VSecondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.
p5406
sV2932
p5407
VFirst, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.
p5408
sV2933
p5409
VWhen we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.
p5410
sV2930
p5411
VI had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
p5412
sV2931
p5413
VThe food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.
p5414
sV3595
p5415
VIt was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food.
p5416
sV1645
p5417
V$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.
p5418
sV1644
p5419
VThe all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.
p5420
sV1647

VEverything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
p5422
sV1646
p5423
VHighly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
p5424
sV1641
p5425
VSeriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
p5426
sV1640
p5427
VAnd you're hungry a few hours later.
p5428
sV1643
p5429
VStay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
p5430
sV1642
p5431
VI've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.
p5432
sV1649
p5433
VThis place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.
p5434
sV1648
p5435
VIt is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!
p5436
sV728
p5437
VWith the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
p5438
sV729
p5439
VThe atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .
p5440
sV579
p5441

p5459
VThe signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.
p5460
sV2809
p5461
VThis place is worth an one-hour drive.
p5462
sV3168
p5463
VBetter than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
p5464
sV3169
p5465
VAlso a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
p5466
sV2802
p5467
VGood for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.
p5468
sV2803
p5469
VIf you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.
p5470

p5471
Vhighly recommended.

p5473
Vnow if they could only get a toaster.
p5474
sV2806
p5475
VAs a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.

p5478
sV3160
p5479

p5486
sV1423
p5487
VWhat makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot.
p5488

sV2157
p5517
VGrowing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.
p5518
sV737
p5519

p5520
sV736
p5521
VThis place is a great stop for great food.
p5522
sV739
p5523
VThe food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
p5524
sV2402
p5525
VThe only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out.
p5526
sV2151
p5527
VHow do you rate home?
p5528
sV1393
p5529
VI really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.
p5530
sV469
p5531
VMy husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,
p5532
sV468

VRestaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
p5534
sV1353
p5535
VDecent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.
p5536
sV464

Vthis is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
p5558
sV1514
p5559
VAnd they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
p5560
sV1517
p5561
VFor some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
p5562
sV2409
p5563
VAnd I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.
p5564

VOne thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.
p5632
sV285
p5633
VThe portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.
p5634
sV284

VBeen going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.

VBest dish is nori-wrapped tuna.

VThe chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.
p5676
sV2495
p5677

p5678
sV258
p5679

p5680
sV2497
p5681
VThe Pad Thai is excellent here, as well.
p5682
sV2496
p5683
VYou rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.
p5684
sV2193
p5685
VBut the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.
p5686
sV1294

p5718
